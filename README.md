Title of the project: Predicting likelihood of heart disease using machine learning approaches.


Description about the Project:

The heart disease remains a significant public health concern worldwide today. Early and accurate prediction of heart disease risk can help the patient to take the quick action towards it. While various risk assessment models exist, there is a need for more sophisticated and precise predictive methods that can leverage the power of machine learning algorithms to enhance accuracy and reliability in predicting individuals at risk of heart disease by taking the use of previous medical records of patients with heart diseases or not with hear disease. The aim of this project is not to eliminate the job of doctors but to give a tool that might be accessible to every person around the world that can use it in early prediction of disease and get the right time diagnosis of the disease.
